# Convolutional Neural Networks

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is known by its power of abstraction e extraction
over the data like images, videos and audios.
This powerful neural network architecture is capable of classify, identify or cluster 
the most complex sample of unstructured data.

The preprocessing layer is structured in some operations:
  - Convolution: is a linear operation that two sequences of values (function-based, or not)
    are crossed, resulting in a new sequence of values.
  - Activation Function (yes, here too): is a function, at most time a ReLU function, intended
    to apply a transformation over the value of image matrix and its convoluted/pooled/sampled matrixes.
  - Pooling
  - Batch Normalization
  - Sampling
